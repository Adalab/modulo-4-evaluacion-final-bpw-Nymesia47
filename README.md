Description

This project involves developing a REST API using Express.js, Node.js, and MySQL to manage information for a selected main entity. I have decided to create an Expense Tracker API that allows users to track their expenses efficiently. The API will support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on expense records.
